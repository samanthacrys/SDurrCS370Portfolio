* Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given the base code that would create the maze for the intelligent agent, be the physical object, movement of the character, simulate a game, check for wins, model a neural network, and actually test the model.

The code that I added was a for loop that looped through the different epochs to check for free cells, make sure that the game didn’t end while true, keep track of wins and losses, observes the environment, remember the information for different episode results, move the character, check for the highest Q-Value, and store the status of the game as win or lose.

* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
    * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists, at the most base level, are the ones that “design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts” (Michigan Technological University, 2024). This means that what they do is important to the world because they help run businesses and society by solving these problems that some people may not be aware of. An example of that would be from one of my previous jobs as an accountant. We used a software called Microsoft Dynamics Great Plains, this software allowed us to keep track of customer accounts and inventory. These were both issues in the business I was working at that were important. Without this, it would have been harder to do this.

    * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My biggest approach is asking what is the problem. If I don’t know the problem, I cannot go further. Once I have done that, I ask why this is a problem. This is because sometimes problems aren’t really the problems people think they are and I need to know and see what the actual issue is. It’s once I have answered these questions that I can start breaking it down into smaller pieces that are more manageable to figure out and code. That way I can approach the process by figuring out what I’m doing and where I’m going. Without that, I could end up somewhere else. This allows me a focus to potentially solve the problem or learn there’s a bigger component to it.

    * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities are being transparent, secure, and protecting individuals. I have to remain secure, minimize my effect on the people using my software, and keep abreast of issues that arise. Without these things, I cannot follow things in an ethical manner. It’s like being HIPAA certified to work in medicine, which I’ve had to do working accounting and IT for hospitals. I had to become HIPAA certified and keep it up-to-date while I working in that field. I had to protect the patients and my ethical concerns to the end user and organization as a computer scientist is the same. I have to protect my end users and my organization, I have to remain upfront and transparent to protect these groups. When there is a conflict, this can be difficult, but I, myself, will stand by the end users because they are the ones that are using the software.
